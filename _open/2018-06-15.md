Comms plan and tracking sheet - talk about our homework!

Marcos has collated blog posts from previous years but would like more if anyone knows of any.
Yo to make openness twitter account
Email Templates / who we're contacting
Dave to proof read templates
Rota for people to read-respond to comms?
To read proposals?
Should we have an openness mini-site forthe public (e.g. a github pages) with contact methods for us and evenrually maybe FAQ?
A FAQ would be nice, and I was also thinking about having an AMA session (could be done with etherpad) - and the AMA could feed the FAQ.
Found a page from last year Open Innovation space, here: https://science.mozilla.org/blog/mozfest-cfp-2017 (I think that having a mini-site  would be awesome!)
Let's make this!

Who wants to do this....?
